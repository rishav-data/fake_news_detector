# 📰 Fake News Detection System

An end-to-end **Fake News Detection** web application that evaluates online news articles using **Natural Language Processing**, **source credibility analysis**, and **external content validation** to estimate the likelihood of misinformation.

The system is designed to be **modular**, **explainable**, and **privacy-conscious**, combining machine learning inference with transparent multi-factor scoring and a clean, accessible web interface.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* 🔍 **Content Analysis with BERT**
  Classifies articles into **Neutral**, **Biased**, or **Contradictory** using a fine-tuned transformer-based language model.

* 🏛️ **Publisher Credibility Scoring**
  Evaluates the historical reliability of known publishers using a curated Supabase database.

* 🌐 **External Content Validation**
  Scans the broader web to check whether similar reporting exists across multiple independent sources, strengthening confidence in widely corroborated news.

* 🧮 **Explainable Scoring Framework (Out of 30)**
  Combines content quality, publisher reliability, and external corroboration into a transparent, interpretable score.

* 🌍 **Flexible Input Methods**
  Supports both **article URLs** (auto-scraped) and **raw article text** (direct input).

- 🔐 **Privacy First Architecture**
  No article content or user data is stored. All processing is performed in-memory and discarded after analysis.

## 🧠 How the System Works

1. **User Input**
   The user submits either a news article link or raw article text.

2. **Article Extraction**

   * URLs are scraped using **Firecrawl**, with a BeautifulSoup-based fallback.
   * Raw text is passed directly into the analysis pipeline.

3. **BERT-Based Content Classification**
   The article is classified into one of three categories:

   * Neutral
   * Biased
   * Contradictory

4. **Multi-Factor Scoring Logic (0–30)**

   **Category Score (0–10)**

   * Neutral → 10
   * Biased → 5
   * Contradictory → 0

   **Publisher Credibility Score (0–10)**

   * Retrieved from Supabase for known publishers
   * Defaults to 0 if the publisher is unknown

   **External Validation Score (0–10)**

   * Measures whether similar or matching news appears across other reputable sources
   * Higher scores indicate stronger cross-source corroboration

5. **Final Verdict Generation**

   ```text
   Total Score = Category Score + Publisher Score + External Validation Score

   ≥ 20  → Possible high credibility
   7–19  → Needs further verification
   < 7   → Credibility uncertain
   ```

The final verdict is designed to assist decision-making while clearly exposing how each component contributes to the result.
