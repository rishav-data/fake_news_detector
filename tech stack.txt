Technology Stack

The Fake News Detection system is implemented using a modular, API-driven architecture focused on explainability, privacy, and scalability.

Backend

Python 3.10

Flask
Used as a lightweight backend framework to orchestrate API requests, scraping, model inference, database lookup, and verdict generation. Flask is chosen for its simplicity and suitability for machine-learning inference pipelines.

Natural Language Processing & Machine Learning

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
Used for contextual analysis and classification of article content into:

Neutral

Biased

Contradictory

HuggingFace Transformers

PyTorch
The BERT model processes article text directly in memory without storing user content.

Scikit-learn
Used for evaluation metrics during model development.

Web Scraping & Content Extraction

Firecrawl
Primary tool for extracting clean article text from URLs, including dynamic and JavaScript-heavy websites.

Requests

BeautifulSoup (fallback)

Scraped article content is passed directly to the BERT model and is not stored in any database.

Database

Supabase (PostgreSQL)
A relational database used exclusively to store developer-curated publisher credibility scores.

Database characteristics:

Read-only during runtime

Contains known publishers and their credibility scores (0–10)

No article content, user data, or scraped text is stored

Scoring & Verdict Logic

Category Scoring

Neutral → 10

Biased → 5

Contradictory → 0

Publisher Credibility Scoring

Retrieved from the Supabase database

Defaults to 0 if the publisher is not found

Final Verdict Logic

Total Score = Category Score + Publisher Credibility Score

Threshold-based interpretation to determine likelihood of news being real or fake

API & Data Format

RESTful APIs built using Flask

JSON request and response format

Stateless inference with no persistent storage of user inputs

Frontend (Out of Scope for Current Phase)

Planned support for:

React (Web)

Kotlin (Android)

Java Swing (Desktop demo)

The backend is frontend-agnostic and designed to integrate with multiple client platforms.
